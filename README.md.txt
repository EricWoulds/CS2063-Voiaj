Voiaj
Voiaj helps to moitvate user to explore Landmarks within the Fredericton area. 
Landmarks are marked on the map as a red marker when they have not been visited yet and the user can change it to green when they have visited the landmark.
The user can seta Landmark as visited by tapping it twice and can set it to unvisited in the same way.
the user can see all the landmarks by hitting Places in the bottom left corner
We have a settings button but did not have time to implement the features but we had planned to allow the user to chnage the map style as well as what Google map locations could show up(gas stations, stores, resturants, etc.) 

Something that has occured when the app is first launched it will ask for persmission for GPS location after this it seems that nothing is loading but if you hit the Map button at the bottom
it fixes the issue and doesnt appear to come up again.
